## Git introduction
Git is a distributed version control system that allows multiple people to work on a project simultaneously without interfering with each other's changes. It tracks changes to files and directories over time, enabling users to revert to previous versions, collaborate on code, and manage project history effectively.

## Git stages
- Untracked - new files in the repository
- Staged - files that are marked to be included in the next commit
- Committed - files that have been saved in the local repository
- Pushed - files that have been uploaded to a remote repository

## Git Commands
Here are some common Git commands:
- `git init`: Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.
- `git clone <repository_url>`: Clones an existing repository from a remote source to your local machine.
- `git add <file>`: Stages changes to a specific file for the next commit.
- `git add .`: Stages all changes in the current directory for the next commit.
